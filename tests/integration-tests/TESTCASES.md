# HTTP Integration Test Inventory

This is the maintenance inventory for the TypeScript API suite. Whenever a file
under `src/suites/` is added, removed, renamed, or materially changes scope,
update this document in the same change. The executable suite and its assertions
are the source of truth; do not keep separate implementation plans or status
trackers here.

## Running the suite

```text
cd tests/integration-tests
pnpm typecheck
```

For an isolated end-to-end run, configure `INTEGRATION_DATABASE_URL` and run:

```text
scripts/api-integration-test.sh
```

The script creates and drops the dedicated integration database. Do not point
it at a database that contains data you need to preserve.

## Suite order

`src/main.ts` resets the database, runs these modules in order, then restores
the seed-only state in its `finally` block. Every current module exports
`IMPLEMENTED = true`.

| Module | File | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| it_00 | `it_00_bootstrap_auth_default_seed.ts` | Seed data, login, and unauthenticated access. |
| it_01 | `it_01_member_invitation_register_roles.ts` | Invitations, registration, member lists, and role perms. |
| it_02 | `it_02_workset_comic_chapter_index.ts` | Workset, comic, chapter indexes, dedicated pinning, profile updates, and positionally aligned comic/pinned-chapter list payloads. |
| it_03 | `it_03_page_reserve_image.ts` | Authoritative hash-plus-extension manifests, optional `new_byte_len` retention, required upload lengths, duplicate-ID and count validation, checksum-bound uploads, image confirmation, replacement, deletion, and page rebuilds. |
| it_04 | `it_04_assignment_invitation.ts` | Assignment joins, invitations, role updates, self role removal, and deletion. |
| it_05 | `it_05_unit_save_order_count.ts` | Unit v2 create/next ordering, 204-then-list contract, counters, snake_case translation body/query formats, and direct PopRaKo export/import replacement round trips. |
| it_06 | `it_06_unit_concurrency.ts` | Serializable same-Page writes with client-side 409/code 8 retries, same-anchor inserts, tombstone delete/Patch commit order, and linked-list completeness. |
| it_07 | `it_07_workflow_sysmail.ts` | Snake_case-body workflow transitions, strongly typed immutable activity events without repository storage JSON or rendered text, pagination, and deferred system mail. |
| it_08 | `it_08_info_update_upload_mark.ts` | Resource updates, checksum-bound avatar/cover PUTs before version-only mark requests, stale upload rejection, announcement create/update/delete, comments, and profiles. |
| it_09 | `it_09_cross_team_perm.ts` | Cross-team authorization isolation (including chapter activity records) and team-scoped online-user leases. |
| it_10 | `it_10_cascade_delete_cleanup.ts` | Cascade deletion and cleanup side effects. |
| it_11 | `it_11_comic_archive.ts` | Permanent comic archive snapshots, lifecycle list filtering, and image-delete prom records. |
| it_12 | `it_12_termbase_term.ts` | Termbase/term lifecycle, native JSON import/export and force merge, inherited lookup, fuzzy isolation, capacity and write perms, response contracts, and termbase/comic/team cascades. |

## Shared fixtures and invariants

- `src/db/seed.ts` owns reset, cleanup, and seed-only assertions.
- `src/http/fixtures.ts` owns reusable API operations, deterministic SHA-256
  image requests, and direct page/avatar/cover PUT uploads using every signed
  response header before mark-uploaded confirmation.
- `src/http/invariants.ts` owns counter, index, workflow, export, and mail
  consistency assertions.
- `src/state/runCtx.ts` is the shared state passed between modules.

When a test reveals a contract change, update the tested source, the relevant
module assertion, and any affected active API document together.
