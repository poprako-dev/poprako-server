//! Domain models for chapter assignments — role masks tracking which
//! workflow roles a user holds for a chapter.
//!
//! Each assignment carries a [`RoleMask`] bitmap. The individual
//! workflow stages a user can act on are derived from the mask.
//!
//! Convert to [`AssignmentInfoView`] for presentation.
