# Chapter Translation Port Format

## PopRaKo JSON

The PopRaKo export document is also the PopRaKo import document. The shared
DTOs are `ChapterTranslationPortView`, `PageSourceTranslationPortView`, and
`UnitTranslationPortView`; their serialized field names are unchanged from
the export contract.

Import uses only page and unit indexes, coordinates, bubble state, translated
text, proofread text, and proofread state. Chapter, comic, page, and unit IDs,
titles, subtitles, and original translator/proofreader IDs are export
metadata. Imported units receive new IDs and are assigned to the importing
user subject to that user's translator and proofreader roles.

PageSource and unit indexes are zero-based. PageSource indexes must be complete and
unique, unit indexes must be non-negative and unique within a page, coordinates
must be finite, the document may contain at most 200 pages, and each page may
contain at most 100 units. The old project shape using `author`, `title`,
`image_filename`, `x`, `y`, `index_in_page`, `is_inbox`, `prooved_text`, and
`is_prooved` is not accepted.

## LabelPlus

LabelPlus import accepts one leading UTF-8 BOM, LF or CRLF line endings,
official and group-generated preamble spacing, and trailing spaces or tabs on
structure lines. Translation text is kept without an overall trim. PageSource files
are matched by page order; filenames are not matched to stored page images.
Export uses three-digit filenames from `000` through `199` by default.
Both translation export endpoints accept `with_raw_ident=true` to use each
page's complete original filename in its LabelPlus image reference. A page
without an original filename falls back to the existing index and image
extension (or `jpg` when object metadata is absent). Original names are used
verbatim, including extension and case; duplicate names are allowed. This
option does not change the PopRaKo document, page ordering, or import matching.
When requested, the export response also includes `raw_idents`, an ordered
array of `{ page_source_id, raw_ident }` mappings for PageSources with stored original
filenames. The field is `null` when `with_raw_ident` is false.

Chapter page allocation accepts `raw_ident` on each `pages` item, and single
page-image allocation accepts the same optional string field. Both replace
the stored value: `"raw_ident":"original 01.png"` supplies the complete
filename, while omission or `"raw_ident":null` means no original identifier.
When resubmitting a chapter manifest, include each filename that should
remain associated with its matched page, even when no upload is needed.
Blank names, control characters, and path separators are rejected. Names are
stored with the resolved page ID in the allocation transaction even when no
upload slot is needed. They take effect on allocation, not upload confirmation.

Original filenames are removed in the publication transaction alongside source
images. Removing pages, including manifest removal, archival, and subtree
deletion, also removes their filenames. Reallocating a retained page updates its
single filename record rather than keeping filename history.

Unit indexes must start at one and be unique within each page. Coordinates must
be finite, the bubble flag must be `1` or `2`, headers must be complete, the
document may contain at most 200 pages, and each page may contain at most 100
units. The service does not add a `label-plus` format alias, CR-only or
non-UTF-8 decoding, or format-specific HTTP error codes.

## Replacement semantics

Both formats fully replace the visible text boxes of every target page. An
empty imported page clears its target page. Existing visible units are soft
deleted in batches of at most 100, the unit order is read again, and imported
units are created in batches of at most 100 in one transaction. Hidden history
is retained. PageSource and chapter counters are written once from the original
state to the final state. Workflow records and stage transitions are part of
the same transaction, so a failure on any page rolls back the whole import.
