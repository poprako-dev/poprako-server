# poprako-server

Rust 2024 backend for manga translation project management. `Cargo.toml`
defines the workspace; `src/lib.rs` defines the server module graph;
`src/main.rs` composes production adapters and starts the Axum server.

## Mandatory guardrails

- Preserve user-authored changes; never overwrite unrelated work.
- Never modify linters unless the user explicitly requests it.
- **Type-safe SQL is mandatory.** All Rust database queries in every
  workspace crate, including tests, must use Diesel's type-safe query DSL
  and typed schema expressions. This applies to joins, subqueries,
  aggregations, filtering, and result projections.
- **Never introduce raw SQL or bypass SQL type checking.** Do not use
  `diesel::sql_query`, `diesel::dsl::sql`, `sql::<...>`, SQL string fragments,
  or string-based query execution through another driver or wrapper.
  Parameter binding, `QueryableByName`, and manually declared SQL result
  types do not make raw SQL type-safe and do not satisfy this rule.
- Query complexity, convenience, performance goals, and existing raw SQL
  elsewhere are never grounds to bypass this requirement. Resolve the
  query through typed Diesel expressions; never silently substitute raw SQL.
- Never hand-edit generated `schema.rs` or `docs/swagger.json`. Locally,
  regenerate schema only with `just mgr-schema`; see the fullchain skill for
  migrations and `docs/AGENTS.md` for OpenAPI generation.
- Releases and production deployments must run through GitHub Actions.
  Production SSH is allowed only from the protected Actions environment
  through the dedicated deployment account. Maintainer machines must never
  execute production deployment scripts.
- Do not run local image/release builds, release helpers, or deployment
  scripts unless the user explicitly requests that exact operation. Use the
  checked-in CI validation scripts for deployment preparation.
- Never apply database migrations during application startup.
- Destructive migration verification requires explicit approval and a
  confirmed disposable database. Exception: `db_poprako_ci` and its
  `poprako-ci-pg` container are already authorized disposable CI resources;
  their validation must complete apply → revert-all → apply. Starting this
  CI database container is permitted and is not a release image build.
- Never bypass or disable commit hooks, including with `--no-verify`.
  Every commit must pass the full pre-commit CI chain.
- CI/CD must invoke checked-in POSIX `sh` scripts directly and must not
  require `just`. Agents must prefer the local `just` recipes below for Rust
  formatting and validation; local schema regeneration requires `just`.
- NEVER EDIT `schema.rs`!!!!!!

## Work and validation

- For non-trivial work: plan → implement → review with targeted validation.
  Read nearby active code and business references before choosing contracts.
- Load the relevant skills below before editing their areas. Keep changes
  limited to the layers the requested behavior needs.
- After editing Rust, run the three canonical Rust checks below, plus tests
  appropriate to the affected code.
- Run custom repository linters only when requested or when validating a CI
  entry point. Basic CI checks: `sh scripts/ci-check.sh`. Full pre-commit CI:
  `sh scripts/ci-local.sh`. A basic check is not a substitute for the full gate.
- Keep Rust files strictly below 600 lines. The current CI script rejects
  only files above 600; passing it does not relax the authoring rule.
- Keep comments in English and blank lines between Rust statements. Do not
  use `if ... else` or create `mod.rs`; use guards, `match`, and `let ... else`.

### Canonical Rust checks

Agents must prefer these exact `just` commands from the repository root.
Their Cargo invocations match the Rust checks in `scripts/ci-check.sh`:

| Local command | Canonical Cargo invocation |
| --- | --- |
| `just fmt-check` | `cargo fmt --all --check` |
| `just fmt` | `cargo fmt --all` |
| `just check` | `cargo check --workspace --all-targets --all-features` |
| `just clippy` | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` |

- After editing Rust, run `just fmt-check`, `just check`, and `just clippy`.
  Only if `just` is unavailable, use the exact Cargo invocations above.
- Use these recipes for routine validation; do not invoke `ci-check.sh` or
  `ci-local.sh` merely to run fmt, check, or clippy. Custom repository linters
  remain subject to the rules above; commits still require the full gate.
- Do not add, remove, or substitute arguments, including package selection,
  target selection, features, profiles, or Clippy lint flags. Do not use
  narrower checks as a preliminary step or retry with a different combination
  after failure. Fix the failure and rerun the same canonical command.
- For formatting changes, use `just fmt`, then `just fmt-check`.
  Apply the same Cargo fallback only if `just` is unavailable.
  Do not use `just check-fix` or `cargo clippy --fix` as a validation shortcut.
- Preserve the pinned toolchain and existing Cargo environment/configuration.
  Do not override `RUSTFLAGS`, `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`,
  `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET`, or profile/incremental settings, create a separate
  target directory, or run `cargo clean` to work around validation failures.
- Deviate only when the user explicitly requests a different invocation or
  when executing a checked-in CI/test/coverage workflow that requires it.
  These rules constrain fmt/check/clippy; choose tests for the affected code.
- When CI changes these three command combinations, update the `justfile`
  recipes and this section in the same change so all three stay aligned.

## Skill routing

Skills live in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Read only those applicable
to the task; follow their links when the referenced area is affected.

| Task | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| Rust source creation, modification, moves, or review | `general-conventions` |
| Backend behavior changes across layers | `implement-fullchain-spec` |
| Use cases, repository contracts, or delivery boundaries | `usecase-boundaries` |
| Instr, Val, View types and dependencies | `data-dto-boundaries` |
| Harn, AppHarn, startup or test composition | `harness-spec` |
| Error classification, conversion, or propagation | `error-handling-spec` |
| Instrumentation, logging, or error-conversion events | `tracing-usage-spec` |
| Tests or externally visible behavior | `test-spec` |
| Rust struct fields in any workspace crate | `struct-field-blank-lines` |
| Module extraction for the file-length limit | `module-splitting-conventions` |

Server-specific domain, DTO, and error rules apply to the server crate.
Do not impose its HTTP types or domain dependencies on infrastructure crates.
